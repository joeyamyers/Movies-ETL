# Movies-ETL
## Project Overview
### Purpose
Amazing Prime wants me to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. I created a function that takes in the three files â€” Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data - and performed the ETL process before adding the data to a PostgreSQL database. 

### Tools Used
* Data ETL using Python/Jupyter Notebook
* PostgreSQL
* pgAdmin
